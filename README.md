# matplotlib-challenge

This one took a while, but I managed to get through. This time I made sure to upload the csv files as well. There are also two specific pages on stack exchange that I found helped me a lot that I would like to link. The first is one that helped me understand the autopct argument in the pie chart section. This link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6170246/how-do-i-use-matplotlib-autopct

It really helped me actually understand how it worked because it was honestly confusing for me at first

The second is this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6181935/how-do-you-create-different-variable-names-while-in-a-loop

This one is for the big loop near the end where I looped over the different drugs and created lists to store their data in. I was struggling to figure out how to make variables in the loop that I could actually loop on so that I wasn't just putting all the volume data into one list regardless of drug regimen. This answer helped me realize dictionaries could let me do that much easier than how I was doing it.

I also want to mention that for the regression line I based it heavily on the fits and regression activity we did in class.
